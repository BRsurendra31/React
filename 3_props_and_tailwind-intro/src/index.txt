# props 
>props stands for properties.
>Props are arguments passed into React components.
>Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.
>React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
>props = attribute in HTML
>props =func argument 

#Example
Add a "brand" attribute to the Car element:

const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;

-The component receives the argument as a props object:

Example
Use the brand attribute in the component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

#Pass Data
Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.

Example
Send the "brand" property from the Garage component to the Car component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand="Ford" />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);

#If you have a variable to send, and not a string as in the example above, you just put the variable name inside curly brackets:

Example
Create a variable named carName and send it to the Car component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  const carName = "Ford";
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand={ carName } />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);
