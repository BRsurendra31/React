# vertual DOM -

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

"createRoot" method creates a DOM like structure behind the scene(drishya) same as the brouwer's DOM that is vertual DOM 
 WE can track the vertual dom structure and can compare with main dom and then can update as per need
