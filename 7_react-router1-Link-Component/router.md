Most of the case react is used to make Single page application (SPA)

where App.jsx is entry point and works as single page 
whatever pages we need we include that inside App.jsx 

when we need multipage application (MPA) , definitely we have to navigate fron one page to another , in  this case Page will reload when we navigate 

so React router overcome this issues of page reloading on navigating page ,
using react router (react library) there will no page reload on navigating and mentains SPA property
